# Vibez

**Find your tribe. Share your vibe.**

_Vibez is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to connect like-minded individuals through shared interests, events, and spontaneous social interactions. It's more than just a social network; it's a community platform built on the idea of finding people who match your "vibe"._

## üß† The Vibe System: Our Core Philosophy

At the heart of Vibez is a unique approach to matchmaking that goes beyond superficial profiles. We believe that true connections start with understanding personality.

Every new user is welcomed with a **conversational, audio-led quiz**. Instead of a boring form, the app asks a series of questions in a natural, friendly tone, making the onboarding process feel like a chat with a friend.

Based on their answers, each user is branded with one of **five core Vibe Attributes**:

-   **üåç The Explorer:** Craves new experiences, travel, and spontaneity. They are adventurous and always ready for the next thrill.

-   **üé® The Creator:** Artistic, imaginative, and sees the world through a unique lens. They express themselves through building, designing, writing, or making music.

-   **ü§î The Thinker:** Loves deep conversation, learning new things, and intellectual curiosity. They are drawn to puzzles, documentaries, and understanding how things work.

-   **ü§ù The Connector:** Thrives on social interaction, community building, and empathy. They are the life of the party and the heart of their social circles.

-   **üßò The Harmonizer:** Values peace, comfort, and creating a sense of balance. They enjoy relaxing activities, nature, and a calm, stable environment.

This initial "Vibe" is the foundation of our entire ecosystem. It powers in-app notifications for new matches and helps foster more meaningful initial connections by introducing you to people who genuinely share your outlook on life.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project leverages a modern and scalable stack, built entirely on Flutter and Firebase.

-   **Frontend:** [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - For building a high-performance, cross-platform mobile application from a single codebase.
-   **Backend:** [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - A comprehensive suite of tools for the backend.
    -   **Authentication:** Firebase Auth for secure Google sign-in.
    -   **Database:** Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL database for real-time data synchronization.
-   **Image Hosting:** [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) - For robust image hosting, optimization, and delivery.
-   **State Management:** [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) - For simple, efficient, and scalable state management.
-   **Architecture:** The app is structured using a clean, service-oriented architecture.
    -   **Models:** Define the data structures (User, Post, Group, etc.).
    -   **Services:** Handle all business logic and communication with Firebase (AuthService, PostService, GroupService).
    -   **Providers:** Manage and provide app-wide state (e.g., the current user's data).
    -   **Screens:** The UI layer, which consumes data from services and providers.
    -   **Widgets:** Reusable UI components (PostCard, GroupCard, etc.).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (version 3.x.x or higher)
-   An IDE like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
-   An active [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account
-   A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account (for image uploads)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vibe-together-app.git
    cd vibe-together-app
    ```

2.  **Set up Firebase**
    -   Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    -   Enable **Authentication** (Google & Email/Password) and **Cloud Firestore**.
    -   Install the Firebase CLI and FlutterFire CLI, then configure the project:
        ```sh
        flutterfire configure
        ```
    -   Download the generated `google-services.json` file and place it in `android/app/`.

3.  **Configure Android**
    -   To enable Google Sign-In, you need to add your machine's SHA-1 fingerprint to your Firebase project settings. Run the following command in the `android` directory:
        ```sh
        ./gradlew signingReport
        ```
    -   Copy the `SHA1` key from the `debug` variant and add it to your Firebase project settings under **Project settings > Your apps > Android**.

4.  **Configure Cloudinary**
    -   Create an **unsigned upload preset** in your Cloudinary settings.
    -   Open `lib/services/image_upload_service.dart` and replace the placeholder values with your **Cloud Name** and **Upload Preset Name**.
      ```dart
      static const String _cloudName = "YOUR_CLOUD_NAME_HERE";
      static const String _uploadPreset = "YOUR_UPLOAD_PRESET_NAME_HERE";
      ```

5.  **Install Dependencies & Run**
    -   Get all the required Flutter packages:
        ```sh
        flutter pub get
        ```
    -   Run the app on your emulator or physical device:
        ```sh
        flutter run
        ```
